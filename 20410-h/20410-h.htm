<h2>Notes.</h2>

<h3>ON CHAUCER'S KNOWLEDGE OF ITALIAN.</h3>

  <p>In the Memoir prefixed to the Aldine edition of the <i>Poetical Works
  of Chaucer</i>, London, 1845, Sir Harris Nicolas expresses an opinion
  that Dan Geoffrey was not acquainted with the Italian language, and
  therefore not versed in Italian literature.</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Though Chaucer undoubtedly knew Latin and French, it is by no means
  certain, notwithstanding his supposed obligations to the Decameron, that
  he was as well acquainted with Italian. There may have been a common
  Latin original of the main incidents of many, if not of all the tales,
  for which Chaucer is supposed to have been wholly indebted to Boccaccio,
  and from which originals Boccaccio himself may have taken them. That
  Chaucer was not acquainted with Italian may be inferred from his not
  having introduced any Italian quotation into his works, redundant as they
  are with Latin and French words and phrases."&mdash;<i>Life of
  Chaucer</i>, pp. 24, 25.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>To which the following note is subjoined:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Though Chaucer's writings have not been examined for the purpose, the
  remark in the text is not made altogether from recollection, for at the
  end of Speght's edition of Chaucer's <i>Works</i>, translations are given
  of the Latin and French words in the poems, but not a single Italian word
  is mentioned."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>If Sir Harris Nicolas had examined the writings of Chaucer with any
  care, he would scarcely have formed or expressed so strange an opinion,
  for he must necessarily have discovered that Chaucer was not only well
  acquainted with the language, but thoroughly well versed in Italian
  literature, and that he paraphrased and translated freely from the works
  of Dante, Petrarca, and Boccaccio. Chaucer would naturally quote Latin
  and French, as being familiar to his cotemporaries, and would abstain
  from introducing Italian, as a knowledge of that language must have been
  confined to a few individuals in his day; and he wrote for the many, and
  not for the minority.</p>

  <p>The circumstances of Chaucer's life, his missions to Italy, during
  which he resided several months in that country, when sent on the king's
  business to Genoa, and Florence, and Lombardy, afforded <!-- Page 518
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page518"></a>{518}</span> him ample
  opportunities of becoming thoroughly acquainted with the language and
  literature of Italy; the acquisition of which must have been of easy
  accomplishment to Chaucer, already familiar with Latin and French. So
  that it is not necessary to endow Chaucer "with all human attainments as
  proof of his having spoken Italian."</p>

  <p>Chaucer's own writings, however, afford the strongest evidence against
  the opinion entertained by Sir Harris Nicolas, and such evidence as
  cannot be controverted.</p>

  <p>Chaucer loves to refer to Dante, and often translates passages from
  the <i>Divine Comedy</i>. The following lines are very closely rendered
  from the <i>Paradiso</i>, xiv. 28.:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p><i>E regna sempre in tre e due ed uno</i>,</p>
      <p><i>Non circonscritto, e tutto circonscrive.</i>"</p>
      <p class="i6">Dante, <i>Il Paradiso</i>, xiv. 28.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">

      <p class="i6"><i>Purgatorio</i>, vii. 121.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>After relating the dread story of the Conte Ugolino, Chaucer refers to
  Dante, from whom perhaps he derived it. (Conf. <i>Inferno</i>,
  xxxiii.)</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Or <i>Dant</i> also."&mdash;<i>The Freres Tale</i>, 7101.</p>
    </div>

  <p>The following lines refer to the <i>Inferno</i>, xiii. 64.:</p>

      <p class="i4">Prologue to the <i>Legend of Good Women</i>, 359.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"<i>Dant</i> that it tellen can" is mentioned in the <i>House of
  Fame</i>, book i.; and Chaucer is indebted to him for some lines in that
  fine poem, as in the description of the "egle, that with feathers shone
  all of gold" = <i>un' aquila nel ciel con penne d'oro</i>; and the
  following line:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="i6"><i>Inferno</i>, ii. 8.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The <i>Knightes Tale</i> exhibits numerous passages, lines, and
  expressions verbally translated from the <i>Teseide</i> of Boccaccio,
  upon which it is founded; such as <i>Idio armipotente</i> = Mars
  armipotent; <i>Eterno admante</i> = Athamant eterne; <i>Paura palida</i>
  = pale drede; <i>Le ire rosse come focho</i> = the cruel ire red as any
  glede. Boccaccio describes the wood in which "Mars hath his sovereine
  mansion" as&mdash;</p>

      <p class="i6"><i>Teseide</i>, book vii.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>There is a purposed grisly ruggedness in the corresponding passage of
  the <i>Knightes Tale</i>, which heightens the horrors of "thilke colde
  and frosty region:"</p>

  <p><i>Troilus and Creseide</i> seems to have been translated from the
  <i>Filostrato</i> of Boccaccio, when <!-- Page 519 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page519"></a>{519}</span> Chaucer was a young
  man, as we are informed by Dan John Lydgate in the Prologue to his
  Translation of Boccaccio's <i>Fall of Princes</i>, where he speaks of his
  "Maister Chaucer" as the "chefe poete of Bretayne," and tells us
  that&mdash;</p>

  <p>Traces of Chaucer's proficiency in Italian are discoverable in almost

      <p class="hg3">"The day gan failen, and the darke night,</p>

      <p class="i6"><i>Inf.</i> iii. 19.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>By the way, Chaucer commences <i>The Assembly of Foules</i> with part
  of the first aphorism of Hippocrates, "<span title="Ho bios brachus hê de technê makrê" class="grk"

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Chaucer was forty years old, or upwards, in 1372, when he was sent as
  an envoy to treat with the duke, citizens, and merchants of Genoa; and
  if, as is probable, he had translated <i>Troilus and Creseide</i> out of
  the "Lombarde tonge" in his youth (according to the testimony of
  Lydgate), it is not unreasonable to infer that his knowledge of Italian
  may have led to his being chosen to fill that office. But, however this
  may be, abundant proof has been adduced that Chaucer was familiarly
  acquainted with Italian.</p>

  <p>I may briefly remark, in conclusion, that the dates and other
  circumstances favour the supposed interview at Padua, between Fraunceis
  Petrark the laureate poet, and Dan Chaucer,</p>

<h3>THE REBELLION OF '45.&mdash;UNPUBLISHED LETTER.</h3>

  <p class="author">Inverness, 16th Aprile, 1746.

  <p>Dear Sirs,</p>

  <p>This day about twelve our army came up with the rebels, about a mile
  above Lord President's house, in a muir called Drumrossie. They began the
  engagement first, by firing from a battery of six guns they had erected
  upon their right; but our cannon played so hott upon them, that they were
  obliged soon to fly, by which means we gote possession of their
  artillery, and so drove them before us for three miles of way. The
  cavalry gave them closs chase to the town of Inverness: <!-- Page 520
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page520"></a>{520}</span> upon which
  the French ambassador (who is not well) sent out an officer, and a drum
  with him, offering to surrender at discretion; to which the duke made
  answer, that the French officers should be allowed to go about on their
  parole, and nothing taken from them. Brigadier Stapleton is among them,
  and God knows how many more officers; for we have not gote home to count
  them yet. Its thought the rebels have between four and five hundred
  killed, and as many taken prisoners already: many more we expect this
  night, parties having been sent out after them. Lord Kilmarnock I saw
  prisoner, and Major Stewart, with many more. Secretary Murray is very
  bad: a party is just now sent for him, intelligence being brought where
  he is. I don't think we have lost thirty men, and not above five officers
  killed, amongst which are Lord Robert Ker, Captain Grosset: the rest
  their names I have forgote. We are now in full possession of this place.
  Some say the Pretender was in the battle, and wounded; but others say he
  was not. Such of them as are left are gone to Fort Augustus. The duke,
  God be praised, is in good health, and all the generalls. His Royal
  Highness behaved as if he had been inspired, riding up and down giveing
  orders himself.</p>

<h3>OLIVER ST. JOHN.</h3>

  <p>In giving the lives of the Commonwealth chief justices, Lord Campbell
  observes (<i>Lives of Chief Justices</i>, vol. i. p. 447.), "in
  completing the list with the name of Oliver St. John, I am well pleased
  with an opportunity of tracing his career and pourtraying his character."
  Then follows a biography of thirty pages. The subject seems to be a
  favourite one with his lordship, and he accordingly produces a striking
  picture, laying on his colours in the approved historical style of the
  day, so as to make the painting an effective one, whether the resemblance
  be faithful or not. But how is it that the noble biographer appears to be
  quite unaware of what really is the only document we have relating to
  Oliver St. John of his own composition, which does give us much light as
  to his career or character? I refer to <i>The Case of Oliver St. John,
  Esq, concerning his Actions during the late Troubles</i>, pp. 14., 4to.,
  n.d. It is a privately printed tract, emanating from St. John himself,
  and was no doubt circulated amongst persons in power at the Restoration,
  with a view to obtaining indemnity and pardon. My copy is signed by
  himself, and has some corrections in his autograph. His Defence is full
  of interesting particulars, some of which are very inconsistent with Lord
  Campbell's speculations and statements. It would, however, occupy too
  much of your space were I to go through the various articles objected to
  by him, and to which he gives his replies and explanations. My object in
  noticing this tract at present, is to prevent any future biographer of
  this Commonwealth worthy, whose life may well be an historical study,
  from neglecting an important source of information. I observe Lord
  Campbell (p. 473.) doubts whether he favoured the measure of making
  Cromwell king. But if we are to believe the title-page of <i>Monarchy
  asserted</i>, 1660, 12mo., he was one of the speakers at the conference
  with Cromwell on the 11th April, 1657, in favour of his assuming the
  title of king. On the list of the committee which follows, the "Lord
  Chief Justice" only is mentioned, but in the speeches a difference seems
  to be made between "Lord Chief Justice" (pp. 6. 7. 15.) and "Lord Chief
  Justice Glynne" (p. 44.), and they would seem to be two different
  speakers. The title-page states distinctly, "the arguments of Oliver St.
  John, Lord Chief Justice, Lord Chief Justice Glyn, &amp;c., members of
  that committee."</p>

  <p>So the first folio edition of Shakspeare. A palpable error, as the

  <p>In taking leave of this idiom, it would not perhaps be amiss to

  can?"</p>

  <p><i>To be at point</i> = to be at a stay or stop, <i>i.e.</i> settled,

  beg permission to inform <span class="sc">Mr. Knight</span> that the

  whose name <!-- Page 522 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  follows:</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Weather Rules.</i>&mdash;The interesting article on "The Shepherd
  of Banbury's Weather Rules" (Vol. vii., p. 373.) has reminded me of two
  <i>sayings</i> I heard in Worcestershire a few months back, and upon
  which my informant placed the greatest reliance. The first is, "If the
  moon changes on a Sunday, there will be a flood before the month is out."
  My authority asserted that through a number of years he has never known
  this fail. The month in which the change on a Sunday has occurred has
  been fine until the last day, when the flood came. The other saying is,
  "Look at the weathercock on St. Thomas's day at twelve o'clock, and see
  which way the wind is, and there it will stick for the next quarter,"
  that is, three months. Can any of your readers confirm the above, and add
  any similar "weather rules?"</p>

  <p><i>Drills presaging Death</i> (Vol. vii., p. 353.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent asks if the superstition he here alludes to in Norfolk is
  believed in other parts. I can give him a case in point in
  Berkshire:&mdash;Some twenty years ago an old gentleman died there, a
  near relative of my own; and on going down to his place, I was told by a
  farm overseer of his, that he was certain some of his lordship's family
  would die that season, as, in the last sowing, he had missed putting the
  seed in one row, which he showed me! "Who could disbelieve it now?" quoth
  the old man. I was then taken to the bee-hives, and at the door of every
  one this man knocked with his knuckles, and informed the occupants that
  they must now work for a new master, as their old one was gone to heaven.
  This, I believe, has been queried in your invaluable paper some time
  since. I only send it by the way. I know the same superstition is still
  extant in Cheshire, North Wales, and in some parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>A friend supplies me with the information that before drills were

  corn or seed sowing, will sometimes happened when "broadcast" was the
  only method. The ill-luck did not relate alone to a <i>death</i> in the
  family of the farmer or his dependents, but to losses of cattle or
  accidents. It is singular, however, that the superstition should have
  transferred itself to the drill; but it will be satisfactory to E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;R.

<h3>A NOTE ON GULLIVER'S TRAVELS.</h3>

  <p>If I may argue from the silence of the latest edition of <i>Gulliver's
  Travels, with Notes</i>, with which I am acquainted, viz. that by W.&nbsp;C.
  Taylor, LL.D., Trinity College, Dublin, the Preface to which is dated May
  1st, 1840, I may say that all the commentators on Swift&mdash;all, at
  least, down to that late date&mdash;have omitted to refer to a work
  containing incidents closely resembling some of those recorded in the
  "Voyage to Lilliput."</p>

  <p>The work to which I allude is a little dramatical composition, the
  Bambocciata, or puppet-show, by Martelli, entitled <i>The Sneezing of
  Hercules</i>. Goldoni, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, has given us the following
  account of the manner in which he brought it out on the stage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Count Lantieri was very well satisfied with my father, for he was
  greatly recovered, and almost completely cured: his kindness was also
  extended to me, and to procure amusement for me he caused a puppet-show,
  which was almost abandoned, and which was very rich in figures and
  decorations, to be refitted.</p>

  <p>"I profited by this, and amused the company by giving them a piece of
  a great man, expressly composed for wooden comedians. This was the
  <i>Sneezing of Hercules</i>, by Peter James Martelli, a Bolognese.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; · &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ·</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"The imagination of the author sent Hercules into the country of the
  pigmies. Those poor little creatures, frightened at the aspect of an
  animated mountain with legs and arms, ran and concealed themselves in
  holes. One day as Hercules had stretched himself out in the open field,
  and was sleeping tranquilly, the timid inhabitants issued out of their
  retreats, and, armed with prickles and rushes, mounted on the monstrous
  man, and covered him from head to foot, like flies when they fall on a
  piece of rotten meat. Hercules waked, and felt something in his nose,
  which made him sneeze; on which, his enemies tumbled down in all
  directions. This ends the piece.</p>

  <p>"There is a plan, a progression, an intrigue, a catastrophe, and
  winding up; the style is good and well-supported; the thoughts and
  sentiments are all proportionate to the size of the personages. The
  verses even are short, and everything indicates pigmies.</p>

  <p>"A gigantic puppet was requisite for Hercules; everything was well
  executed. The entertainment was productive of much pleasure; and I could
  lay a bet, that I am the only person who ever thought of executing the
  Bambocciata of Martelli."&mdash;<i>Memoirs of Goldoni</i>, translated by
  John Black, 2 vols., duod. vol. i. chap. 6.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is certainly not necessary to point out here in what respects the
  adventures of Hercules, the <i>animated mountain</i>, and those of
  Quinbus Flestrin, the <i>man mountain</i>, differ from, or coincide with,
  each other, as the only question I wish to raise is, whether a careful
  analysis of Martelli's puppet-show ought, or ought not, to have been
  placed among the notes on <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p>In reply to J. M. G. of Worcester, who inquires for a MS. volume of
  English poetry containing some lines attributed to Shakspeare, and which
  is described in Thorpe's <i>Catalog</i> of MSS. for 1831, I can supply
  some particulars which may assist him in the research. The MS., which at
  one period had belonged to Joseph Hazlewood, was purchased from Thorpe by
  the late Lord Viscount Kingsborough; after whose decease it was sold, in
  November, 1842, at Charles Sharpe's literary sale room, Anglesea Street,
  Dublin. It is No. 574. in the auction catalogue of that part of his
  lordship's library which was then brought to auction.</p>

  <p>The volume has been noticed by Patrick Fraser Tytler, in his <i>Life
  of Sir Walter Raleigh</i>, Edinburgh, 1833 (in Appendix B, p. 436., of
  2nd edit.), where, citing the passage from Collier, which is referred to
  by J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G., he asserts that the lines are not Shakspeare's, but
  Jonson's. But he does not appear to me to have established his case
  beyond doubt; as the lines, though found among Jonson's works, may,
  notwithstanding, be the production of some other writer: and why not of
  Shakspeare, to whom they are ascribed in the MS.? Some verses by Sir
  J.&nbsp;C. Hobhouse originally appeared as Lord Byron's: and there are <!--
  Page 524 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page524"></a>{524}</span>
  numerous instances, both ancient and modern, of a similar attribution of
  works to other than their actual authors.</p>

  <p><i>The Island of Prospero.</i>&mdash;We cannot assert that Shakspeare,
  in the <i>Tempest</i>, had any particular island in view as the scene of
  his immortal drama, though by some this has been stoutly maintained.
  Chalmers prefers one of the Bermudas. The Rev. J. Hunter, in his
  <i>Disquisition on the Scene, &amp;c. of the Tempest</i>, endeavours to
  confer the honour on the Island of Lampedosa. In reference to this
  question, a statement of the pseudo-Aristotle is remarkable. In his work
  "<span title="peri thaumasiôn akousmatôn" class="grk"

  he mentions Lipara, one of the Æolian Islands, lying to the north of
  Sicily, and nearly in the course of Shakspeare's Neapolitan fleet from
  Tunis to Naples. Among the <span title="polla teratôdê" class="grk"

  <p>If we compare this with the aerial music heard by Ferdinand
  (<i>Tempest</i>, I. 2.), especially as the orchestra is represented by
  the genial burin of M. Retsch in the fifth plate of his well-known
  sketches (<i>Umrisze</i>), it will appear probable that Shakspeare was
  acquainted with the Greek writer either in the original or through a
  translation. As far as I am aware, this has not been observed by any of
  the commentators.&mdash;From <i>The Navorscher</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">J. M.

  <p><i>Coincident Criticisms.</i>&mdash;I shall be obliged if you will
  allow me through your pages to anticipate and rebut two charges of
  plagiarism. When I wrote my Note on a passage in <i>The Winter's Tale</i>
  ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 378.), I had not seen the <i>Dublin
  University Magazine</i> for March last, containing some remarks on the
  same passage in some respects much resembling mine. I must also declare
  that my Note on a passage in <i>All's Well that ends Well</i> ("N. &amp;
  Q.," Vol. vii., p. 426.) was posted for you some time before the
  appearance of A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.'s Note on the same passage ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  vii., p. 403.). The latter coincidence is more remarkable than the
  former, as the integrity of the amended text was in both notes discussed
  by means of the same parallel passage. <i>Apropos</i> of A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B.'s
  clever Note, permit me to say, that though at first it appeared to me
  conclusive, I now incline to think that Shakspeare intended Helen to
  address the <i>leaden messengers</i> by means of a very hyperbolic
  figure: "wound the still-piecing air that sings with piercing" is a
  consistent whole. If, as A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. rightly says, <i>to wound the air</i>
  is an impossibility, it is equally impossible that the air should utter
  any sound expressive of sensibility. The fact of course is, that the
  cannon-balls <i>cleave</i> the air, and that by so cleaving it a shrill
  noise is produced. The cause and effect may, however, be metaphorically
  described, by comparing air to Bertram. I believe it is a known fact that
  every man who is struck with a cannon-ball cries out instinctively.
  Shakspeare therefore might, I think, have very poetically described the
  action and effect of a cannon-ball passing through the air by the strong
  figure of <i>wounding the air that sings with the piercing which it is
  enduring</i>.</p>

  <p>In concluding this Note, I beg to express what is not merely my own,
  but a very general feeling of disappointment in respect of <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier's</span> new edition of Shakspeare. To it, with a
  new force, may be applied the words of A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. in "N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  vi., p. 296.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"But the evil of these emendations is not in this instance confined to
  the mere suggestion of doubt; the text has absolutely been altered in all
  accessible editions, in many cases <i>silently</i>, so that the ordinary
  reader has no opportunity of judging between <i>Shakspeare</i> and his
  improvers."</p>

  being a rich fellow enough, "and a fellow that hath had <i>lawsuits</i>"

<h3>THE C&OElig;NACULUM OF LIONARDO DA VINCI.</h3>

  <p>I have in my possession a manuscript critique on the celebrated
  picture of The Last Supper by Lionardo da Vinci, written many years ago
  by a deceased academician; in which the writer has called in question the
  <i>point of time</i> usually supposed to have been selected by the
  celebrated Italian painter. The criticisms are chiefly founded on the
  copy by Marco Oggioni, now in the possession of the Royal Academy of
  Arts.</p>

  <p>Uniform tradition has assumed that the moment of action is that in
  which the Saviour announces the treachery of one of his disciples "Dico
  vobis quia unus vestrum me traditurus est." Matth. xxvi. 21., Joan. xiii.
  21., Vulgate edit.; and most of the admirers of this great work have not
  failed to find in it decisive proofs of the intention of the painter to
  represent that exact point of time. <!-- Page 525 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page525"></a>{525}</span></p>

  <p>The author of the manuscript enters into a very detailed examination
  of the several groups of figures which compose the picture, and of the
  expression of the heads; and he confesses his inability to find in them
  anything decisively indicating the period supposed to be chosen. He
  remarks that nine at least of the persons, including the principal one,
  are evidently engaged in animated conversation; that instead of that
  concentrated attention which the announcement might be supposed to
  generate, there appears to be great variety of expressions and of action;
  and that neither surprise nor indignation are so generally prominent, as
  might have been expected. He inclines to think that the studied diversity
  of expression, and the varied attitudes and gestures of the assembled
  party, are to be regarded as proofs of the artist's efforts to produce a
  powerful and harmonious composition, rather than a natural and truthful
  representation of any particular moment of the transaction depicted by
  him.</p>

  <p>The work in question is now so generally accessible through the medium
  of accurate engravings, that any one may easily exercise his own judgment
  on the matter, and decide for himself whether the criticism be well
  founded.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind that the subject had long been a familiar
  decoration of conventual refectories before the time when Lionardo
  brought his profound knowledge of external human nature, and his
  unsurpassed powers of executive art, to bear on a subject which had
  before been treated in the dry, conventional, inanimate manner of the
  Middle Ages. The leading features of the traditional picture are
  retained: the long table, the linen cloth, the one-sided arrangement of
  the figures, the classic drapery, and the general form and design of the
  apartment, are all to be found in the earlier works; and must have been
  considered, by observers in general, far more essential to the correct
  delineation of the scene than any adherence to the exact description of
  it in any one of the Evangelists. But as the subject was usually
  introduced into refectories for the edification of the brethren assembled
  with their superior at their own meals, it does not seem likely that the
  treachery of Judas should have been intended to be the prominent action
  of the picture. It was a memorial of the institution of the Eucharist,
  although the Christ was not represented as dispensing either bread or
  wine. In such a case, if any particular point of time was ever
  contemplated by the artist, he might judiciously and appropriately select
  the moment when the Saviour was announcing, in mysterious words, the
  close of his mission&mdash;as in St. Matthew and St. Mark; or was
  teaching them a lesson of humility when the spirit of rivalry and strife
  had disclosed itself among them&mdash;as we find in St. Luke and St.
  John.</p>

  <p>It is not perhaps generally known that the statutes of Queen's
  College, Oxford, prescribe the order of sitting at the common table in
  manner which evidently refers to the <i>c&oelig;naculum</i> of the old
  church painters.</p>

  <p><i>Child-mother.</i>&mdash;Four months ago, on board the Brazil
  packet, the royal mail steam-vessel Severn, there was an instance of a
  "child-wife," which might be worthy of a place among your curiosities of
  that description.</p>

  <p>She was the wedded wife of a Brazilian travelling from the Brazils to
  Lisbon, and her husband applied for permission to pay the "reduced
  passage money" for her as being "under twelve years of age!"</p>

  <p>As the regulation on that head speaks of "<i>children</i> under twelve
  years of age," this <i>conscientious</i> Brazilian's demand could not be
  countenanced.</p>

  <p>His wife's age was under eleven years and a half, and (<i>credat

<h3>FURTHER QUERIES RESPECTING BISHOP KEN.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. vii., p. 380.)</p>

  <p>In a <i>Collection of Poems</i>, in six volumes, by several Hands
  (Dodsley, 5th edition, 1758), and in vol. iii. p. 75., is found "An
  Epistle from Florence to T.&nbsp;A., Esq., Tutor to the Earl of
  P&mdash;&mdash;. Written in the year 1740. By the Honourable
  &mdash;&mdash;." Can any one explain an allusion contained in these three
  lines of the epistle?</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or with wise Ken judiciously define,</p>
      <p>When Pius marks the honorary coin</p>
      <p>Of Caracalla, or of Antonine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is hardly to be supposed that the Ken here named could mean the
  bishop, who died so far back as 1711. Was there a coin-collector of that
  name living about 1740?</p>

  <p>We learn (from Ken's <i>Prose Works</i>, ed. Round, pp. 93, 94.) that
  the Bishop's sister, "my poor sister Ken," most probably then a widow,
  lost her only son, who died at Cyprus, in 1707. Was this Mrs. Ken the
  Rose Vernon, sister of Sir Thomas Vernon, of Coleman Street, London, and
  the wife of Jon Ken, the bishop's eldest brother, and treasurer of the
  East India Company? This Jon and Rose Ken are represented, in Mr.
  Markland's Pedigree of the Ken family, as still living in 1683. Is there
  no monumental memorial of this Treasurer Ken, or his family, in any of
  the London churches?</p>

  <p>In Mr. Macaulay's <i>History of England</i>, 5th ed., vol. ii. p.
  365., he states that "it was well known that one of the most opulent
  dissenters of the City had begged that he might have the honour of giving
  security for Ken," when the seven bishops were bailed, previous to their
  trial. On what authority (for none is cited) does this statement
  rest?</p>

  <p>Can any one give a clue to this passage from a letter written to Mr.
  Harbin, Lord Weymouth's chaplain, by Bishop Ken, and dated "Winton, Jan
  22." [1701]:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I came to Winchester yesterday, where I stay one post more, and then
  go either to Sir R.&nbsp;U. or L. Newton, where you shall hear from
  me."&mdash;Ken's <i>Prose Works</i>, by Round, p. 53.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can "Sir R. U." (the <i>U</i> perhaps being a mistake for <i>W.</i>)
  designate Sir Robert Worsley, Bart., of Chilton, in the county of
  Southampton, married to Lord Weymouth's daughter? and can "L. Newton" be
  a mistake for Long Sutton, in Hants? or may it be Long Newton, in the
  hundred of Malmesbury?</p>

<h3>THE REV. JOHN LAWSON AND HIS MATHEMATICAL
MANUSCRIPTS.</h3>

  <p>In the year 1774 the Rev. John Lawson, B.D., Rector of Swanscombe in
  Kent, published <i>A Dissertation on the Geometrical Analysis of the
  Antients, with a Collection of Theorems and Problems without solutions
  for the Exercise of young Students</i>. This work was printed anonymously
  at Canterbury, but the merits of the essay did not permit the author to
  remain long in obscurity; the real writer was immediately known to most
  of the geometers of the day, and the elegant character of many of the
  theorems and problems, led to a general desire that their solutions
  should be published in a separate work. In accordance with this
  intention, it was announced on a fly-sheet attached to some copies of the
  work, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The author of this publication being a man of leisure, and living in
  a retired situation, remote from any opportunity of conversation with
  mathematicians, would be extremely glad of a correspondence with any
  such, who are willing to be at the expense of the same; or if this be
  thought too much, will pay the postage of his answers to their letters.
  But no letters, except post-paid, can be received by him; otherwise a
  door would be opened for frolic, imposition, and impertinence. Any new
  geometrical propositions, either theorems or problems, would be received
  with gratitude, and if sent without solutions, he would use his best
  endeavours to return such as might be satisfactory. Any new solutions of
  propositions already in print, <i>especially of those included in the
  present collection</i>, would also be very agreeable. If a variety of
  such demonstrations essentially different from those of the original
  authors should be communicated, he proposes at some future time to
  publish them all, with a fresh collection for further exercise; and then
  each author's name shall be affixt to his own solution, or any other
  signature which he shall please to direct. Any person who shall favor the
  publisher with his correspondence shall have speedily conveyed to him the
  solutions of any propositions contained in this collection, which he may
  be desirous of seeing. Letters (post-paid) directed for P.&nbsp;Q., to be left
  at Mr. Nourse's, Bookseller, in the <!-- Page 527 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page527"></a>{527}</span> Strand, London, will
  be carefully transmitted on the first day of each month, and all
  correspondents may expect answers during the course of that month."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In consequence of this appeal, Mr. Lawson was speedily in
  correspondence with several of the most able geometers then living, and
  amongst the rest, Messrs. Ainsworth, Clarke, Merrit, Power, &amp;c.,
  appear to have furnished him with original solutions to his collection of
  theorems and problems. The manuscript containing these solutions must
  have been of considerable size, since a portion of it was sent down to
  Manchester about July, 1777, for the purpose of obtaining Mr. Ainsworth's
  remarks and corrections; and Mr. Lawson is requested, in a letter bearing
  date "August 22, 1777," to "send the next portion when convenient."
  Whether Mr. Lawson did so or not, I have not yet been able to ascertain;
  but this much is certain, the manuscript was never printed, and would
  most probably either be disposed of at the death of its compiler, or
  previously transferred to the possession of some geometer of Mr. Lawson's
  acquaintance. Several of the <i>original</i> letters which passed between
  the respective parties relating to this manuscript are at present in the
  hands of two or three of the Lancashire geometers, but no one seems to
  know anything of the manuscript itself. May I then request that the
  fortunate holder of this yet valuable collection will make himself known
  through the medium of the widely circulated pages of "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p><i>"Wanderings of Memory."</i>&mdash;In Brayley's <i>Graphic and

  <p><i>Chapel Sunday.</i>&mdash;I had the pleasure of spending a Sunday in
  the course of the last summer in the neighbourhood of Keswick, among the
  delightful lake scenery of England. I there learned that in the village
  of Thornthwaite it was Chapel Sunday, and on inquiry I was told that
  there were a few other villages in the neighbourhood where there was also
  a Chapel Sunday. Upon this day it is the custom of young people to come
  from neighbouring places to attend worship at the village church or
  chapel, and the afternoon partakes of a merry-making character at the
  village inn. There appeared, as far as I could see, no excesses attending
  the anniversary, all being respectable in their conduct. Can any of your
  Cambrian readers inform me the origin of this anniversary?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Prestoniensis</span>.

  <p><i>Proud Salopians.</i>&mdash;I have never heard a satisfactory
  account of the origin of this title, given to persons belonging to my
  native county.</p>

  <p>In the neighbourhood the following story is frequently related, but
  with what authority I cannot tell, viz. "That upon the king (Query
  which?) offering to make Shrewsbury a city, the inhabitants replied that
  they preferred its remaining the largest borough in England, rather than
  it should be the smallest city; their pride not allowing them to be small
  among the great."</p>

  <p>If this history of the term be true, it would appear that the name
  should only be applied to <i>burgesses of Shrewsbury</i>.</p>

  <p><i>George Miller, D.D.</i>&mdash;In the year 1796, George Miller,
  subsequently the author of <i>Modern History Philosophically
  Illustrated</i>, and many other well-known works (of which a list appears
  in a recent Memoir), was appointed Donnelan Lecturer in Trinity College,
  Dublin; and delivered a course of sermons or lectures on "An Inquiry into
  the Causes that have impeded the further Progress of Christianity." I
  should be very glad indeed to know whether these Sermons have appeared in
  print; and if so, when and where published? I have not been able to
  procure a copy.</p>

  <p>With regard to the Donnelan Lectureship, I may add, that a legacy of
  1243<i>l.</i> was bequeathed to the College of Dublin by Mrs. Anne
  Donnelan, of the parish of St. George, Hanover Square, in the county of
  Middlesex, spinster, "for the encouragement of religion, learning, and
  good manners." The particular mode of application was entrusted to the
  Provost and Senior Fellows; and accordingly, amongst other resolutions of
  the Board, passed Feb. 22, 1794, are to be found the following: "That a
  Divinity Lecture, to which shall be annexed a salary arising from the
  interest of 1200<i>l.</i>, shall be established for ever, to be called
  Donnelan's Lecture;" and "That one moiety of the interest of the said
  1200<i>l.</i> shall be paid to the Lecturer as soon as he shall have
  delivered the whole number [six] of the lectures; and the other moiety as
  soon as he shall have <i>published</i> four of the said Lectures."</p>

  grounds, that of setting up a cross in his chapel, are confessedly
  unsatisfactory. But, besides this, it is alleged that he died with a
  Roman Catholic book of devotion in his hand, and that the last person in
  whose company he was seen was a priest of that persuasion. One would be
  glad to have this question sifted.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Neither Calamy nor Brook has furnished any biographical notices of
  Dr. Faithfull Teate. When he wrote <i>Ter Tria</i>, in 1658, he was a
  "Preacher of the Word at Sudbury in Suffolk." A second edition of it was
  published in 1669. In 1665 appeared his <i>Scripture Map of the
  Wildernesse of Sin</i>," 4to. In a discourse on <i>Right Thoughts, the
  Righteous Man's Evidence</i>, he has the following passage, accommodated
  to his own destitute state after his ejectment: "The righteous man, in
  thinking of his present condition of life, thinks it his relief, that the
  less money he has he may go the more upon trust; the less he finds in his
  purse, seeks the more in the promise of Him that has said, 'I will never
  leave thee, nor forsake thee;' so that he thinks no man can take away his

  <p><i>Kelway Family.</i>&mdash;Can any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q."
  guide me to anything like a pedigree of the family of <i>Kelloway</i>,
  <i>Kaloway</i>, or <i>Kelway</i>; which I find from Lysons'
  <i>Devonshire</i> possessed the manor of Mokesbean in that county from
  the time of Henry II.?</p>

  <p>In the first year of Edward III., when the property of those who
  suffered after the battle of Boroughbridge was restored, John de
  Keilewaye was found "hæres de integro sanguine" to Lord Gifford of
  Brimesfield.</p>

  <p>The last of the family appears to have been John Kelloway of
  Collampton in Devon, who married Joan Tregarthian; and dying in 1530,
  left co-heiresses married to Greville of Penheale, Codrington of
  Codrington, Harwood, and Cooke.</p>

  <p>The arms of the family are singular, being, Argent within a bordure
  engrailed sable, two groving irons in saltire sable, between four pears
  Or.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The pedigree of this family will be found in two copies by Munday of
  the "Visitation of Devonshire," <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 1564, in
  the Harleian MSS. 1091. p. 90., and 1538, p. 2166. The only difference in
  the arms is, in both copies, that there is <i>no bordure engrailed</i>;
  but this has probably been added since as a <i>difference</i>, as was
  often done to distinguish families. The name is here spelt
  <i>Kelloway</i>, and the pedigree begins with "Thomas Kelloway of
  Stowford in County Devon, who married Anne, daughter of &mdash;&mdash;

  <p><i>Regatta.</i>&mdash;What is the etymology of the word

  <i>Remigata</i>, the art of rowing." Florio, in his <i>Worlde of
  Wordes</i>, has "<i>Regattare</i>, Ital. to wrangle, to cope or fight for
  the mastery." The term, as denoting a showy species of boat-race, was
  first used in this <!-- Page 530 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page530"></a>{530}</span> country towards the close of the last
  century; for the papers of that time inform us, that on June 23, 1775, a
  regatta, a <i>novel</i> entertainment, and the first of the kind, was
  exhibited in the river Thames, in imitation of some of those splendid
  shows exhibited at Venice on their grand festivals. The whole river, from
  London Bridge to the Ship Tavern, Millbank, was covered with boats. About
  1200 flags were flying before four o'clock in the afternoon, and vessels
  were moored in the river for the sale of liquors and other refreshments.
  Before six o'clock it was a perfect fair on both sides the water, and bad
  liquor, with short measure, was plentifully retailed. Plans of the
  regatta were sold from a shilling to a penny each, and songs on the
  occasion sung, in which "regatta" was the rhyme for "Ranelagh," and
  "royal family" echoed to "liberty."]</p>

<h3>CURFEW.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., pp. 53. 112.)</p>

  <p>It will be remembered that when Mr. Webster, one of the greatest of
  American statesmen, was on his death-bed, in October last, he requested
  his son to read to him that far-famed "Elegy" of Gray:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The editor of the <i>Boston Journal</i>, after referring to this
  circumstance, which he says has caused an unexampled demand for the works
  of Gray in the United States, goes on to give the result of his
  researches in many old English works, respecting the origin and meaning
  of the word <i>curfew</i>, which I trust will interest not only your
  correspondents who have written on the subject, but also many of your
  readers. I glean from the clever article now before me the following
  brief notices, which I have not yet met with in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>In King Alfred's time the curfew was rung at eight o'clock, and called
  the "cover fire bell," because the inhabitants, on hearing its peals,
  were obliged to cover their fires, and go to bed. Thomson evidently
  refers, in the following lines, to this tyrannical law, which was
  abolished in England about the year 1100:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The shiv'ring wretches at the curfew sound,</p>
      <p>Dejected sunk into their sordid beds,</p>
      <p>And through the mournful gloom of ancient time,</p>
      <p>Mused sad, or dreamt of better."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>On the people finding that they could put out their fires and go to
  bed when they pleased, it would appear, from being recorded in many
  places, that the time of ringing the curfew bell was first changed from
  eight to nine o'clock, then from nine to ten, and afterwards to the early
  hours of the morning. Thus we find in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The curfew bell hath rung:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Tis <i>three o'clock</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In Shakspeare's works frequent mention is made of the curfew. In the
  <i>Tempest</i> he gives the following:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"You whose pastime</p>
      <p>Is to make midnight mushrooms&mdash;that rejoice</p>
      <p>To hear the solemn curfew."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>Measure for Measure</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<i>Duke.</i> Who call'd here of late?</p>
      <p><i>Provost.</i> None since the curfew rung."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In <i>King Lear</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"This is the foul fiend Flibertigibbet;</p>
      <p>He begins at curfew, and walks to the first cock."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This old English custom of ringing the curfew bell was carried by the
  Puritan fathers to New England; and where is the Bostonian of middle age
  who does not well recollect the ringing of the church bell at nine
  o'clock, which was the willing signal for labourers to retire to bed, and
  for shopmen to close their shops?</p>

  <p>Before closing this Note, may I be allowed to inform <span
  class="sc">Mr. Sansom</span>, that <i>Charlestown</i> is in
  Massachusetts, and only separated from Boston by Charles River, which
  runs between the two cities. The place to which he refers is

<h3>THE "SALT-PETER-MAN."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., pp. 377. 433. 460.)</p>

  <p>The statute against monopolies (21 Jac. I. c. 3.) contains a clause
  (sec. 10.) that its provisions should not extend to any commission grant
  or letters patent theretofore made, or thereafter to be made, of, for, or
  concerning the digging, making, or compounding of saltpetre or gunpowder,
  which were to be of the like force and effect, <i>and no other</i>, as if
  that act had never been made.</p>

  <p>In the famous "Remonstrance of the State of the Kingdom" agreed upon
  by the House of Commons in November, 1641, there is special allusion to
  the vexation and oppression of the <!-- Page 531 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page531"></a>{531}</span> subject by purveyors,
  clerks of the market, and saltpetre men. (<i>Parliamentary History</i>,
  x. 67.)</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards was passed an act (which obtained the royal assent)
  giving liberty for importing gunpowder and saltpetre, and for making of
  gunpowder. The preamble asserts that the importation of gunpowder from
  foreign parts had of late times been against law prohibited, and the
  making thereof within this realm ingrossed; whereby the price of
  gunpowder had been excessively raised, many powder works decayed, this
  kingdom very much weakened and endangered, the merchants thereof much
  damnified, many mariners and others taken prisoners and brought into
  miserable captivity and slavery, many ships taken by Turkish and other
  pirates, and many other inconveniences had from thence ensued, and more
  were likely to ensue, if not timely prevented. (17 <i>Car. I.</i> c.
  21.)</p>

  <p>Lord Clarendon, in reviewing the various "important laws" of the Long
  Parliament to which the king assented, makes the following observations
  with reference to this particular act:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"'An Act for the free making Saltpetre and Gunpowder within the
  Kingdom:' which was a part of the prerogative; and not only considerable,
  as it restrained that precious and dangerous commodity from vulgar hands;
  but, as in truth it brought a considerable revenue to the crown, and more
  to those whom the crown gratified and obliged by that license. The
  pretence for this exemption was, 'the unjustifiable proceeding of those
  (or of inferior persons qualified by them) who had been trusted in that
  employment,' by whom, it cannot be denied, many men suffered: but the
  true reason was, that thereby they might be sure to have in readiness a
  good stock in that commodity, against the time their occasions should
  call upon them."&mdash;<i>History of Rebellion</i>, book iii.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On the 3rd April, 1644, the Lords and Commons passed an ordinance for
  the making of saltpetre, &amp;c. This was grounded on the following
  allegations:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"1. The great expence of gunpowder, occasioned by the then war within
  his Majesty's dominions, had well near consumed the old store, and did
  exhaust the magazines so fast, that without a larger supply, the navy
  forts and the land armies could not be furnished.</p>

  <p>"2. Foreign saltpetre was not in equal goodness with that of our own
  country, and the foreign gunpowder far worse conditioned and less
  forcible than that which is made in England.</p>

  <p>"3. Divers foreign estates had of date prohibited the exportation of
  salt-peter and gunpowder out of their own dominions and countries, so
  that there could be but little hope or future expectation of any peter or
  powder to be brought into this kingdom, as in former times, which would
  enforce us to make use of our own materials."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these circumstances, it was held most necessary that the digging
  of saltpetre and making of gunpowder should by all fit means be
  encouraged, at that time when it so much concerned the public safety;
  nevertheless, to prevent the reviving of those <i>oppressions and
  exactions</i> exercised upon the people, under the colourable authority
  of commissions granted to <i>salt-peter-men</i>; which burden had been
  eased since the sitting of that Parliament. To the end there might not be
  any pretence to interrupt the work, it was ordained that the committee of
  safety, their factors, workmen, and servants, should have power and
  authority, (within prescribed hours) to search and dig for saltpetre in
  all pigeon-houses, stables, cellars, vaults, empty warehouses, and other
  outhouses, yards, and places likely to afford that earth.</p>

  <p>The <i>salt-peter-men</i> were to level the ground and repair damage
  done by them; or might be compelled to do so by the deputy-lieutenants,
  justices of the peace, or committees of parliament.</p>

  <p>The <i>salt-peter-men</i> were also empowered to take carts, by the
  known officers, for carriage of the liquor, vessels, and other utensils,
  from place to place, at specified prices, and under limitations as to
  weight and distance; and they were freed from taxes and tolls for
  carriages used about their works, and empowered to take outhouses,
  &amp;c., for their workhouses, making satisfaction to the owners.</p>

  <p>This ordinance was to continue for two years, from 25th March,
  1644.</p>

  <p>An ordinance of a similar character was passed 9th February, 1652, to
  be in force till 25th March, 1656 (<i>Scobell</i>, 231.).</p>

  <p>By an act of the Lord Protector and Parliament, made in 1656, it was
  enacted that no person or persons should dig within the houses or lands
  of any person or persons of the commonwealth for the finding of
  saltpetre, nor take the carriages of any person or persons for the
  carrying of their materials or vessels, without their leave first
  obtained or had. (<i>Scobell</i>, 377.) This is the act referred to by
  <span class="sc">Broctuna</span> ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol. vii., p. 434.), and
  by my friend <span class="sc">Mr. Isaiah Deck</span> ("N. &amp; Q.," Vol.
  vii., p. 460.), though I am not certain that <span class="sc">Mr.
  Deck's</span> inference be correct, that this act was passed in
  consequence of the new and uncertain process for obtaining the
  constituents of nitre having failed; and it is quite clear that Lord Coke
  could not have referred to this act. The enactment referred to is
  introduced by way of proviso in an act allowing the exportation of goods
  of English manufacture (<i>inter alia</i>, of gunpowder, when the price
  did not exceed 5<i>l.</i> per cwt.).</p>

  <p>Allow me, in connexion, with this subject, to refer to Cullum's
  <i>History of Hawsted</i>, 1st edition, pp. 150. and 151., also to the
  statute 1 Jac. II. c. 8. s. 3., by which persons obtaining any letters
  patent for the sole making or importing gunpowder are subjected to the
  pains and penalties of præmunire.</p>

<h3>FORMS OF JUDICIAL OATHS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vii., p. 458.)</p>

  <p>Will you permit me to make a few observations in reply to the Queries
  of <span class="sc">Mr. H.&nbsp;H. Breen</span> on this subject?</p>

  <p>There is hardly any custom more ancient than for a person imposing a
  promise on another to call on him to bind himself by an oath to the due
  performance of it. In this oath the person swearing calls on God, the
  king, his father, or some person or thing to whom he attaches authority
  or value, to inflict on him punishment or loss in case he breaks his
  oath. The mode of swearing is, in one particular, almost everywhere and
  in every age the same.</p>

  <p>When a father, a friend, a sword, or any corporeal object is sworn by,
  <i>the swearer places his hand upon it</i>, and then swears. When a man,
  however, swore by the Deity, on whom he cannot place his hand, he raised
  his hand to heaven towards the God by whom he swore.</p>

  <p>When Abraham made Abimelech swear to obey him, he caused him to place
  his hand under his thigh, and then imposed the oath; and when Jacob, by
  his authority as a father, compelled his son Joseph to swear to perform
  his promise, he ordered him to go through a similar ceremony. (Genesis,
  ch. xxiv. v. 5., and ch. xlvii. v. 29.)</p>

  <p>In the prophet Daniel we read that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The man clothed in linen which was upon the waters, held up his right
  hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by Him that liveth for ever
  and ever," &amp;c.&mdash;Daniel, ch. xii. v. 7.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the Revelation we also find&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"And the angel, which I saw stand upon the sea and the earth, lifted
  up his hand to heaven and sware by Him that liveth for ever and ever,"
  &amp;c.&mdash;Revelation, ch. x. v. 5, 6.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Your correspondent inquires how oaths were taken prior to their being
  taken on the Gospel.</p>

  <p>Among the nations who overthrew the Roman empire, the most common mode
  of swearing was on the relics of the saints. In England, I think, the
  most common mode was to swear on the corporalia or eucharistic elements,
  whence we still have the common phrase "upon your corporal oath." In each
  case the hand was placed on the thing sworn by.</p>

  <p>The laws of the Alamanni as to conjurators, direct that the sacrament
  shall be so arranged that all the conjurators shall place their hands
  upon the coffer (containing the relics), and that the principal party
  shall place his hand on all theirs, and then they are to swear on the
  relics. (<i>Ll. Alam.</i> cap. 657.)</p>

  <p>The custom of swearing on the Gospels is repeatedly mentioned in the
  laws of the Lombards. (<i>Ll. Longo.</i> 1 tit. 21. c. 25.; <i>Ll.
  Longo.</i> 2. tit. 55. c. 2., and c. 2. tit. 34. <i>et al.</i>)</p>

  <p>In the <i>Formularies of Marculphus</i>, two forms of oaths are given,
  one says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In palatio nostro super capella domini Martini ubi reliqua sacramenta
  percurrunt debeat conjurare."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the other we read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Posita manu supra sacrosanctium altare sancti ... sic juratus dixit.
  Juro per hunc locum sanctum et Deum altissimum et virtutis sancti ...
  quod," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the laws of Cnût of England, two forms of oath are given. They both
  begin with "By the Lord before whom this relic is holy." (<i>Ancient Laws
  and Justice of England</i>, p. 179.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent asks "what form of Judicial oath was first
  sanctioned by Christians as a body?"</p>

  <p>In the history of the Council of Constantinople, it is stated
  that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"George, the well beloved of God, a deacon and keeper of the records,
  having touched the Holy Gospels of God, swore in this manner, 'By these
  Holy Scriptures, and by the God who by them has spoken,'" &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>At the Council of Nice it is said that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Prayer having been offered up, every one saluted the Holy Gospels,
  the venerated cross and image of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and
  of our Lady the mother of God, and placed his hands upon them in
  confirmation of what he had said."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From these I infer that the custom of swearing on the Gospels received
  the sanction of the church at a very early period.</p>

  <p>In reply to the question as to other modes of swearing, it may be said
  briefly, that men swore by anything to which they attached any
  importance, and generally by that to which they attached most
  importance.</p>

  <p>By the laws of the Alamanni, a wife could claim her <i>Morgen-gabe</i>
  (or the gift of the morning after the wedding night) by swearing to its
  amount on her breast; and by the Droits d'Augsbourg, by swearing to it on
  her two breasts and two tresses.</p>

  <p>Nothing was more common than for a man to swear by his beard. This
  custom is alluded to by one of Shakspeare's fools, who suggests that if a
  certain knight swore by his honour, and his mistress by her beard,
  neither of them <i>could</i> be forsworn.</p>

  <p>In the canons of the Fourth Council of Orleans, we read&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Le Roi lui-même, ou le plus renommé des chevaliers présents, ayant
  découpé le paon, se leva, et mettant la main sur l'oiseau, fit un
  v&oelig;u hardi; Ensuite il passa le plat, et chacun de ceux qui le
  reçurent fit un v&oelig;u semblable."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the year 1306, Edward I. of England swore an oath on two swans.</p>

  <p>It was also very common from an early period, both in England and
  abroad, to swear by one, two, seven, or twelve churches. The deponent
  went <!-- Page 533 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page533"></a>{533}</span> to the appointed number of churches, and
  at each, taking the ring of the church door in his hand, repeated the
  oath.</p>

  <p>One of the most curious specimens of the practice of swearing men by
  that to which they attached most importance, is to be found in an Hindoo
  law. It says, let a judge swear a Brahmin by his veracity; a soldier by
  his horses, his elephants, or his arms; an agriculturist by his cows, his
  grain, or his money; and a Soudra by all his crimes.</p>

  <p class="address">Surbiton.

  <p>I know nothing about judicial oaths: but the origin of the form <span
  class="sc">Mr. Breen</span> states to be used by the Roman Catholics of
  the Continent, and the Scotch Presbyterians, may be seen in Dan. xii. 7.:
  "When he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware
  by him that liveth for ever." And in Revelation x. 5, 6.: "And the angel
  ... lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by him," &amp;c. See also
  Genesis xiv. 22.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Washing Collodion Pictures&mdash;Test for Lens.</i>&mdash;As I was
  indebted to the kindness of <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span>, amongst
  other friends, for my original initiation into the mysteries of
  photography, it may appear somewhat presumptuous in me to differ from one
  who has had so much more experience in a point of practice. I allude to
  that of <i>washing</i> the collodion negative after developing,
  previously to fixing with the hyposulphite of soda; but, probably, the
  reasons I urge may have some weight. As the hyposulphite solution is
  intended to be used repeatedly, it appears to me not advisable to
  introduce into it <i>any free acid</i> (which must occur if the negative
  be not washed, although the quantity at each operation may be small),
  because it causes a decomposition of the salt, setting free
  <i>sulphurous</i> acid, and also sulphur; which last is slightly soluble
  in the hyposulphite of soda, and thus the sulphur is brought in contact
  with the reduced silver, and forms a sulphuret of that metal. But the
  change does not stop here: for, by the lapse of time, oxygen is absorbed,
  and thus a <i>sulphate of silver</i> is formed, and the colour changed
  from black to white. That sulphur is set free by the addition of an acid
  to the solution of hyposulphite of soda, is fact so easily demonstrable
  both to the eyes and nose of the operator, that no one need remain long
  in doubt who is desirous of trying the experiment.</p>

  <p>A correspondent desires to know how to test the coincidence or
  otherwise of the visual and actinic foci of a combination: this is very
  readily accomplished by the aid of a <i>focimeter</i>, which can be
  easily made thus:</p>

  <p>Procure a piece of stout card-board, or thin wood covered with white
  paper, on which draw a considerable number of fine black lines, or cover
  it with some fine black net (what I believe the ladies call
  <i>blond</i>), which may be pasted on. Cut up the whole into a dozen
  good-sized pieces of any convenient form, so that about four square
  inches of surface at least be allowed to each piece. Paste over the
  <i>net</i> a circular or square label about the size of a shilling,
  bearing a distinctly printed number one on each piece, from 1 upwards;
  and arrange the pieces in any convenient manner by means of wires
  inserted into a slip of wood; but they must be so placed that the
  <i>whole</i> can be seen from one point of view, although each piece must
  be placed so that it is <i>one inch</i> farther from the operator than
  the next lowest number. Having placed the camera eight or ten feet from
  the cards, carefully focus to any one of the numbers, 4 or 5 for instance
  and observe, not that the <i>number</i> is distinct, but that the minute
  lines or threads of the net are visible: then take a picture, exposing it
  a very short time, and the threads of the card bearing the number that
  was most perfectly in focus visually <i>ought</i> to be most distinct;
  but, if otherwise, that which is most distinct will not only show whether
  the lens is over or under corrected, but will indicate the <i>amount</i>
  of error. If under corrected, a lower number will be most distinct; if
  over corrected, a higher.</p>

  <p><i>Test for Lenses.</i>&mdash;I beg to submit to a <span
  class="sc">Country Practitioner</span> the following very simple test for
  the coincidence of the chemical and visual foci of an achromatic
  lens:</p>

  <p>Take a common hand-bill or other sheet of printed paper, and having
  stretched it on a board, place it before the lens in an oblique position,
  so that the plane of the board may make an angle with a vertical plane of
  about thirty or forty degrees. Bring any line of type about the middle of
  the sheet into the true visual focus, and take a copy of the sheet by
  collodion or otherwise. Then, if the line of type focussed upon be
  reproduced clearly and sharply on the plate, the lens is correct; but if
  any other line be found sharper than the test one, the foci disagree; and
  the amount of error will depend on the distance of the two lines of type
  one from the other on the hand-bill.</p>

  <p><i>Improvement in Positives.</i>&mdash;I have great pleasure in
  communicating to you an improvement in the process of taking positives,
  which may not be uninteresting to some of your readers, and which ensures
  by far the most beautiful tints I have yet seen. I take three ounces of
  the hyposulphite of soda, and dissolve it in one pint of distilled or
  rain water; and to this I add about one or one and a half grains of
  pyrogallic acid, and seventy grains <!-- Page 534 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page534"></a>{534}</span> of chloride of silver;
  which must be squeezed up between the finders facilitate its solution and
  separate the lumps, which, in their dry state, are tough, and not easily
  pulverised. The whole is then to be set aside for a week or two in a warm
  place. The solution, at first colourless, becomes brown, and ultimately
  quite opaque; in this state it is fit for use, and the longer kept the
  better it becomes. I generally use French paper for this process, and,
  according to the time of immersion, obtain fine sepia or black tints; the
  latter requiring long over-exposure to the light, and proportionately
  long exposure to the action of the liquid; which however will be found,
  particularly when old, to have a more rapid action than most other
  setting liquids, and has the merit of always affording fine tints,
  whatever the paper used. I imagine the pyrogallic acid to possess a
  reducing influence on the salts of silver employed; but this effect is
  only produced by its combination with the hyposulphite of soda and
  chloride of silver. I may add, that in any case the pictures should be
  much overdone before immersion, as the liquid exerts a rapid bleaching
  action on them; and when the liquid becomes saturated, a few crystals of
  fresh hyposulphite will renew its action.</p>

  <p>P. S.&mdash;In answer to a <span class="sc">Country
  Practitioner</span>, he will find great assistance in choosing his lens
  by laying it on a sheet of blue wove post paper, when he will immediately
  perceive the slightest yellow tinge in the glass, this being the fault
  which frequently affects many well-ground and well-made lenses. Of
  course, for sharpness of outline he must be guided entirely by experiment
  in the camera; but where weakness of action exists, it most frequently
  arises from this yellow colouration, and which the manufacturers say is
  very difficult to avoid.</p>

  <p><i>Cheap Portable Tent.</i>&mdash;M. F. M. inquires for a cheap and
  portable tent for working collodion out of doors. I have been using one
  lately constructed on the principle of Francis's camera stand. It has a
  good size table, made like the rolling patent shutters; and it is not
  necessary to stoop, or sit down at your work, which is a great
  consideration on a hot day: you may get them of any respectable dealer in
  photographic apparatus; it is called Francis's Collodion Tent.</p>

  fluid for collodion positives, the formula for which was published in the
  last Number of "N. &amp; Q.," is merely a weak solution of the
  protonitrate and protosulphate of iron. It does not, as he seems to
  think, contain any lead; for the whole of the latter is precipitated as
  sulphate, which the acetic acid does not dissolve even to the smallest
  extent: and <span class="sc">Mr. Sisson</span> will find that an
  equivalent proportion of the nitrate of baryta will answer equally as
  well as the nitrate of lead.</p>

  <p>I have myself for a long time been in the habit of using a weak
  solution of the protonitrate of iron in conjunction with acetic acid for
  positive pictures; for, although I do not consider it so good a developer
  as that made according to the formula of <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span>, it produces very good pictures; occupies very little time
  in preparing, and will moreover keep good for a much longer time than a
  more concentrated solution would.</p>

  <p><i>Loselerius Villerius</i> (Vol. vii., p. 454.).&mdash;I beg to
  inform S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;S. that his copy of the New Testament, which wants the
  title-page, was printed by Henry Stephens the second, at Geneva, in the
  year 1580. As to it being "valuable," I should not consider him
  unfortunate if he could exchange it for a shilling.</p>

  <p>Loselerius Villerius was Pierre l'Oyseleur de Villiers, a professor of
  Genevan divinity, who came over to London, and there published Beza's
  Latin version of the New Testament, in 1574. He was not, however, as your
  correspondent supposed him to be, the editor of the decapitated volume in
  question; but Beza transferred his notes to an impression completed by
  himself.</p>

  <p>S. A. S. has, in the next place, inquired for any satisfactory "list
  of editions of the Bible." It appears that, so far as he is concerned, Le
  Long, Boerner, Masch, and Cotton have lived and laboured in vain.</p>

  <p>The folio Bible lastly described by your correspondent is <i>not</i>

  <p><i>Hevristic</i> (Vol. vii., p. 237.).&mdash;The term
  <i>hevristisch</i>, in the first edition of the translation of Kant's
  <i>Critik</i>, is not given in the vocabulary appended to the
  translation; but under the word <i>ostensiv</i> it is stated that in its
  meaning it stands opposed to the word <i>euristic</i> (<i>hevristisch</i>
  in German). But in the second edition, published in 1818, it is remarked,
  under the words <i>evristic</i>, <i>euristic</i>, <i>hevristisch</i>,
  that the term should, in Sir Wm. Hamilton's opinion, be <i>euretic</i> or
  <i>heuretic</i>; the word <i>hevristisch</i> being an error of long
  standing in German philosophy. The derivation of <i>euretic</i> would be
  from <span title="heuretikos" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F51;&rho;&epsilon;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>.</p>

  <p>In Tissot's translation, <i>hevristisch</i> is rendered by
  <i>heuristique</i>; in Mantovani's, by <i>evristico</i>; in Born's, by
  <i>heuristicus</i>. In Krug's <i>Lexicon</i>, <i>hevristik</i> is given
  as derived from <span title="heuriskô, heurein" class="grk"
  >&epsilon;&#x1F51;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&kappa;&omega;,
  &epsilon;&#x1F51;&rho;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;</span>. The <i>hevristic</i>
  method, Krug remarks, is also called the <i>analytical</i>. It may be
  added, that in the first edition of the <i>Critik</i> (Riga, 1781), the
  word is <i>hevristisch</i>. In the fourth edition (Riga, 1794), published
  also in Kant's lifetime, it is <i>hevristisch</i>. In Rosenkranz's
  edition (Leipzig, 1838), the word is changed into <i>heuristisch</i>; and
  also, in another edition of the same year, published also at Leipzig, it
  is written <i>heuristisch</i>, and not <i>hevristisch</i>.</p>

  <p>In respect to the Leipzig edition of 1818, which is that now before
  me, the term <i>hevristisch</i>, in speaking of <i>hevristich</i>
  principles, is particularly alluded to. (See page 512. line 10.) I do not
  find, after a hasty inspection, this word changed, in any of the editions
  I possess, to <i>empirisch</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Creole</i> (Vol. vii., p. 381.).&mdash;The word appears to be a

  America;" whilst in the old dictionary of Stevens (1726) it is
  translated, "Son of a Spaniard and a West India woman." In Brande's
  <i>Dictionary of Science</i>, &amp;c. Creole is said to mean the
  descendants of whites born in Mexico, South America, or the West Indies,
  the blood remaining unmixed with that of other races, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>Von Tschudi says, that in South America the Spaniards apply the term

  and even to poultry.</p>

  be glad to ask a still more extensive question, which will probably
  explain the object of the former more limited one. Is it <i>usual</i>, in
  any of the unreformed branches of the church on the continent, to find a
  similar appellation (implying distinct nationality) employed in
  authoritative documents, <i>e.g.</i> would it be possible to find in the
  title-pages of any Missal, &amp;c., such words as "in usum Ecclesiæ
  Hispanicæ, Lusitanæ, Gallicanæ?" If not now, was it more customary in
  mediæval times, and when did it cease?</p>

  <p>Should we be justified in saying, that at <i>every</i> period of her
  existence, with rare exceptions, the <i>Anglican church</i>, consciously
  or unconsciously, maintained the theory of her nationality with greater
  distinctness than any of the continental churches? I fancy I have heard,
  though I cannot state on what authority, that this assertion might be
  made most truly of the Portuguese church, and should be very glad to have
  any light thrown on the subject by your able correspondent. Certain it
  is, that amongst the various complaints made against Cardinal Wiseman and
  the Papal aggressors, it has never been laid to their charge, that they
  arrogated to themselves the title of members of the <i>Anglican
  church</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Names first given to Parishes</i> (Vol. iv., p. 153.).&mdash;I wish
  to repeat this Query in another form, and particularly in reference to
  the termination <i>-by</i>. I suspect that wherever a cluster of
  villages, like that given by F.&nbsp;B., occurs with this Danish suffix, it is
  a proof that the district was originally a colony of Danes. The one in
  which I reside (the hundreds of Flegg), from its situation is
  particularly likely to have been so. Its original form was evidently that
  of a large island in the estuary of the Yare, which formed numerous
  inlets in its shores; and this was flanked on each aisle by a Roman
  garrison, one the celebrated fortress of Garianonum, now Burgh Castle,
  and the other Caistor-next-Yarmouth, in which a camp, burying-ground,
  &amp;c., besides its name, sufficiently attest its Roman origin. The two
  hundreds of Flegg, (or Fleyg, as appears on its common seal) comprise
  twenty villages, thirteen of which terminate in <i>-by</i>. These are
  Ormesby, Hemesby, Filby, Mauteby, Stokesby, Herringby, Thrigby,
  Billockby, Ashby or Askeby, Clippesby, Rollesby, Oby, and Scratby or
  Scroteby.</p>

  <p>Professor <span class="sc">Worsaae</span>, I believe, considers
  Ormesby to have been originally Gormsby, <i>i.e.</i> Gorm's or Guthrum's
  village, but I have not his work at hand to refer to. Thrigby, or Trigby
  as it is vernacularly pronounced, and Rollesby, may take their names from
  Trigge or Tricga, and Rollo, names occurring in Scandinavian history. I
  should feel obliged if Professors <span class="sc">Worsaae</span> and
  <span class="sc">Stephens</span>, or other Scandinavian antiquaries and
  scholars, would kindly inform me if my surmises are correct, and if the
  rest of the names may be similarly derived. I should add that Stokesby
  fully hears out the suggestion of C. (Vol. v., p. 161.), as there is even
  now a ferry over the Bure at that point. The district is entirely
  surrounded by rivers and extensive tracts of marshes, and intersected by
  large inland lakes, locally termed "Broads," which undoubtedly were all
  comprised in the estuary, and which would form safe anchorages for the
  long galleys of the Northmen.</p>

  <p><i>Grafts and the Parent Tree</i> (Vol. vii., p. 436.).&mdash;In order
  to insure the success of grafts, it is material that they be inserted on
  congenial stocks: delicate-growing fruits require dwarf-growing stocks;
  and free luxuriant-growing trees require strong stocks. To graft scions
  of delicate wooded trees on strong stocks, occasions an over-supply of
  sap to the grafts; and though at first they seem to flourish, yet they do
  not endure. A few examples of this sort may lead to an opinion, that
  "grafts, after some fifteen years, wear themselves out;" but the opinion
  is not (generally speaking) well founded. I have for many years grafted
  the old <i>Golden Pippin</i> on the <i>Paradise</i> or <i>Doucin</i>
  stock, and found it to answer very well, and produce excellent fruit.
  Taunton has long been famous for its <i>Nonpareils</i>, which are there
  produced in great excellence and abundance. The Cornish
  <i>Gilliflower</i>, one of our very best apples, was well known in the
  time of King Charles I.; and, as yet, shows no symptoms of decay: that
  fruit requires a strong stock.</p>

  <p>The ancient <i>Ribston Pippin</i> was a seedling:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"It has been doubted by some, whether the tree at Ribston Hall was an
  original from the seed: the fact of its not being a grafted tree has been
  satisfactorily ascertained by Sir Henry Goodricke, the present
  proprietor, by causing suckers from its root to be planted
  out&mdash;which have set the matter at rest that it was not a grafted
  tree. One of these suckers has produced fruit in the Horticultural Garden
  at Chiswick."&mdash;Lindley's <i>Guide to the Orchard and Kitchen

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>That well-worn quotation, "who shall decide when doctors disagree,"
  must, we should think, invariably suggest itself to the reader of every
  new book upon the subject of Shakspeare's text. A few months since <span
  class="sc">Mr. Collier</span> gave to the world a volume of <i>Notes and
  Emendations from Early Manuscript Corrections in a Copy of the Folio
  1632</i><a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
  which was hailed by many, ourselves among the number, as a most valuable
  contribution to Shakspearian literature. From this favourable view of
  these manuscript emendations, many whose opinions upon such matters
  deserve the highest respect at once avowed their dissent; and we now find
  that we have to add to this number <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>,
  who has given us the result of his examination of them in a volume
  entitled <i>The Text of Shakspeare vindicated from the Interpolations and
  Corruptions advocated by John Payne Collier, Esq., in his Notes and
  Emendations</i>. No one can put forth higher claims to speak with
  authority on any points connected with Shakspeare than <span
  class="sc">Mr. Singer</span>, who has devoted a life to the study of his
  writings; and none can rise from a perusal of his book without
  recognising in it evidence of <span class="sc">Mr. Singer's</span>
  fitness for editing the works of our great dramatist, and feeling anxious
  for his revised edition of them. But we think many will regret that,
  while pointing out the Notes and Emendations from which he dissents,
  <span class="sc">Mr. Singer</span> should not have noticed those which he
  regards with favour; and that, in his anxiety to vindicate the purity of

  <p>* <span class="sc">Example.</span>&mdash;At the commencement of the
  year 1841, a person aged thirty took out a Policy for 1000<i>l.</i>, the
  annual payment for which is 24<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; in 1847 he
  had paid in premiums 168<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>; but the profits
  being 2-1/4 per cent. per annum on the sum insured (which is 22<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> per annum for each 1000<i>l.</i>) he had 157<i>l.</i>
  10<i>s.</i> added to the Policy, almost as much as the premiums paid.</p>

  <p>The Premiums, nevertheless, are on the most moderate scale, and only
  one-half need be paid for the first five years, when the Insurance is for
  Life. Every information will be afforded on application to the Resident
  Director.</p>
